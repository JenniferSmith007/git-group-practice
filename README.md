If you were to go around and survey people on what the most famous dinosaur that ever lived, they would probably say the Tyrannosaurus Rex.

If you were to ask about the scariest dinosaur, you’d probably get the same answer again.

For those of you who don’t know that much about dinosaurs, here’s a general idea of what a Tyrannosaurus Rex was like.

Firstly, they were terrifying large, measuring up to 40 feet (12.3 m) long and 12 feet (3.66 m) when measured up to the top of their hips.

They were one of the largest of all known predators that ever roamed the earth, weighing in at around 9.3 tons (8.4 tonnes) to 15.4 tons (14 tonnes).

Now that we have a vague idea of what a Tyrannosaurus Rex (T-Rex) looked like, let’s have a look at some of the more interesting details that really stood them apart from other dinosaurs!
